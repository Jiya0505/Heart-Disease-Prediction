# Heart-Disease-Prediction
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various medical factors. 
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. 
Leveraging a dataset containing a comprehensive set of patient attributes including age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more, I employed advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and predict the presence of heart disease.
